In the present day, the most common approach for protectingAC540e78de64711531635cce45ec39b28c APIs is by using shared secrets. 
EveryAC57e8aee5102ed4dc404198fdde936093 time the AC83d72f891de4e356bbab80ad3f124276API is called, this secret must be presented which

However none of these mechanisms provide a way to ensure the integrity of the data being transferred. Also, for certain clients, shared secrets is not a possible solution (e.g. SPA). In these scenarios, HTTP signatures plays an important role in uplifting the security of the APIs
